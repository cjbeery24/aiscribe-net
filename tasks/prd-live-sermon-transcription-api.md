# Product Requirements Document: Live Sermon Transcription REST API

## Introduction/Overview

The Live Sermon Transcription REST API is a .NET-based backend service that enables churches and religious organizations to stream live audio from their services and receive real-time AI-powered transcriptions. The system provides a multi-tenant platform where organizations can manage their transcription sessions, save transcripts, and control access through role-based permissions. The primary goal is to make sermon content more accessible through accurate, real-time transcriptions while providing organizations with flexible subscription options and comprehensive management tools.

## Goals

1. **Enable Real-Time Transcription**: Provide seamless live audio streaming and AI-powered transcription capabilities for religious services
2. **Multi-Tenant Organization Management**: Support multiple church organizations with isolated data and user management
3. **Flexible Subscription Model**: Implement tiered subscription plans with usage-based limits and feature access
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensure proper permissions and security through organizational user roles
5. **Searchable Content**: Make transcribed sermons easily discoverable through robust search and filtering
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Provide live notifications and progress updates during transcription sessions
7. **External Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with streaming platforms, payment systems, and transcription services

## User Stories

### Organization Admin

- As an organization admin, I want to invite and manage users in my organization so that I can control who has access to our transcription services
- As an organization admin, I want to configure audio and transcription settings so that our services are transcribed according to our preferences

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Frontend User Interface**: This PRD covers only the REST API backend; frontend applications are separate
- **Video Processing**: Only audio transcription is supported; video analysis is not included
- **Multi-Language Support**: Initial version will focus on English transcription only
- **On-Premise Deployment**: Service will be cloud-hosted only, no on-premise installation support
- **Advanced AI Features**: Beyond transcription (sentiment analysis, topic extraction) are not included
- **Mobile SDK**: Direct mobile integration; mobile apps should use the REST API
- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Beyond transcription (noise reduction, audio enhancement) are out of scope

## Design Considerations

### API Design

- Follow RESTful conventions with clear resource-based endpoints
- Implement consistent error handling and HTTP status codes
- Use JSON for all request/response payloads
- Support pagination for list endpoints
- Implement API versioning strategy (v1, v2, etc.)

### Real-Time Communication

- Use SignalR for WebSocket connections and real-time updates
- Implement connection management and automatic reconnection
- Provide fallback mechanisms for clients without WebSocket support

### Data Models

- **Users**: Authentication, roles, organization association
- **Organizations**: Settings, subscription info, usage tracking
- **Transcription Sessions**: Audio metadata, status, real-time progress
- **Transcriptions**: Saved content, searchable text, metadata
- **Subscriptions**: Plan details, usage limits, billing information

## Technical Considerations

### Framework & Architecture

- Use .NET 8 with ASP.NET Core for the REST API
- Implement Clean Architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns
- Use Entity Framework Core for data access layer
- Implement CQRS pattern for complex query operations

### Database Strategy

- Use SQL Server for primary relational data (users, organizations, subscriptions)
- Consider Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB for transcription content storage
- Implement proper indexing strategy for search functionality
- Use Redis for caching and session management

### Security

- Implement JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- Use HTTPS only with proper SSL/TLS configuration
- Implement rate limiting and API throttling
- Follow OWASP security guidelines for API development

### Performance & Scalability

- Design for horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Implement asynchronous processing for transcription operations
- Use message queues (Azure Service Bus/RabbitMQ) for background tasks
- Optimize database queries and implement caching strategies
